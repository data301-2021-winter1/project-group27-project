## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The purpose for this project was to obtain a greater understanding of the connection between crimes and mental disorders. Mental disorders have been known to play a key role in criminals and the types of crimes they have commited. From previous courses we've taken, we understand that there can be different factors that influence a criminal from growing up to their current environment. The severity of their disorder may also impact the sentence to their crime. All members of this group were interested in a psychology topic, and a better understanding of crimes in relation to mental disorders could provide intel on better treatments or even for early indications and prevention of these crimes. There are many questions that can be asked in this type of dataset, what factors can alter the rate of a crime (such as SES, family, community, etc.), what allowed for recidivism for the number of arrests, and more! 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset was a study made Dean Harper that was published by National Institute of Justice. The purpose of this study was to see the relationship between crimes and mental disorders and whether one could find any crime and/or psychological patterns. This data was made under three sample groups, jail inmates who had psychiatric contacts, jail inmates who didn't have psychiatric contacts, and psychiatric patients who were not in jail. All the data were received from the years 1960-1977 and it include many factors/variables that were taken into consideration, such as demographic characteristics, recidivism, and types of offenses sentenced. This dataset will be studied in the interest of learning human behaviours based on mental disorders, specifically in the criminal aspect.
